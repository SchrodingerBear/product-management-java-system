START:
You woke up in a Shore with a Dizzy Head
You don't know what happened, why you are here and who you are

Not far a way from you is a wrecked Ship
There is nothing around you but a Large Dark Forest that gives you chills
You stand up, and start walking to find clue..

Village:
Guard: Woah, are you ok? You seems lost
Guard: Do you have a name? Where did you come From?
Player: I do not know my Name, I do not remember anything
Guard: Oh poor soul, I'll let you in, go Find Chief, he can help you
